# Personality Prediction System via CV Analysis

### 🧠 Domain: Artificial Intelligence  

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
This system uses NLP and machine learning to predict personality traits (like extroversion, openness, etc.) from CV/resume text content.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NLP (NLTK)
- Scikit-learn (ML)
- docx2txt
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Logistic Regression (as sample model)

---

## 🔬 How It Works
1. Extracts text from `.docx` CVs.
2. Cleans and preprocesses the text.
3. Applies a trained ML model to predict personality traits based on content patterns.
4. Outputs a personality trait such as: `Extroversion`, `Openness`, `Conscientiousness`, etc.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Text extraction and cleaning from resumes
- Personality prediction using machine learning
- Using NLP techniques like tokenization and stopword removal
- Model loading, TF-IDF features, and inference
